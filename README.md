## How to use the app 
The app has two main functionalities:

- Defining new boulders (and add them to the list) 
To define a new boulder on your wall, you have to define: 
- the name of the boulder
- the name of the setter 
- the grade
- the selection of holds on the image. To select the holds, you have to use the 'Tap' function in the image. Click and hold shift while selecting your holds, to select multiple holds.
