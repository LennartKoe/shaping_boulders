Shaping Boulder is a browser app where you can define your own routes from a picture of any wall. 

# Usage 
Disclaimer: At the moment it is not yet possible to add your own picture of a wall. Hopefully will work soon!! 

## How to start the app

Naviagte to the directory where you installed the app and type in the terminal:

```
panel serve app.ipynb
```

Copy the link provided after the command in a web browser to use the app.


## How to use the app 
The app has two main functionalities: 
- Selecting boulders from a pre-defined list 

In the 'Select your Boulder' box, you can click on the boulders in the table and they will be displayed in the image of your wall. If you wanna see only boulders in a grade range you can adjust the sliders above the table and click 'Confirm Selection' to only see those.

- Defining new boulders (and add them to the list) 
To define a new boulder on your wall, you have to define: 
  - the name of the boulder
  - the name of the setter 
  - the grade
  - the selection of holds on the image. To select the holds, you have to use the 'Tap' function in the image. Click and hold shift while selecting your holds, to select multiple holds.

All 4 variables need to be defined, otherwise a warning pops up. 

When you are happy with your boulder, click 'Confirm Selection' to save your boulder. It will pop up in the table on the right. 


At any point you can click the green button 'Clear Selection', to clear everything and have a clean setup again.
